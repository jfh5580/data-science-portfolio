# üöÄ Joon's Data Science Portfolio

Welcome to my data science playground! Explore a variety of projects I've undertaken for academic, self-learning, and pure curiosity. Each project is presented as a Jupyter notebook, with more visual details available on [My page](https://github.com/jfh5580)

**Please note**: The data used in these projects, found under the "data" directory, is for demonstration purposes only.

## üõ†Ô∏è Getting Started

To run these Python notebooks locally, follow these simple steps:

1. Install dependencies by running `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
2. Start a Jupyter Notebook server or use your preferred environment to run the notebooks.
