# üöÄ Joon's Data Science Portfolio

Welcome to my data science playground! Explore a variety of projects I've undertaken for academic, self-learning, and pure curiosity. Each project is presented as a Jupyter notebook, with more visual details available on [My page](https://github.com/jfh5580)

**Please note**: The data used in these projects, found under the "data" directory, is for demonstration purposes only.

## üõ†Ô∏è Getting Started

To run these Python notebooks locally, follow these simple steps:

Start a Jupyter notebook server or use your preferred environment to run the notebooks.
   
## üìÇ Project Categories

### ü§ñ Advanced Machine Learning

- **Capital Bikeshare Machine Learning Predictions**: Focusing on specific days, pick-ups, and drop-offs for each station, selecting interpretable linear regression models.

### üñ•Ô∏è Deep Learning and NLP

- **Coffee Bean Roast Classification with CNN**: Classifying coffee beans based on their roast levels. The aim is to create a model that can automatically determine the roast level of a coffee bean from images of the beans.[View Project](projects/CoffeeBeansRoast_CNN.ipynb)

- **Engineering Customer Complaint Prompts with the GPT-3.5 and Llama 2 Model**: Leveraging large language models (LLMs) to generate and augment a dataset of synthetic customer complaints for testing complaint-classification NLP models.
  [View Project](projects/GPT3_5_Prompt_Engineering.ipynb)

- **Spam Email Classification Using Naive Bayes**: leveraging the power of the Naive Bayes algorithm, this project aims to provide an effective solution for automating the identification of spam emails, ultimately improving email communication and security.
