# üöÄ Joon's Data Science Portfolio

Welcome to my data science playground! Explore a variety of projects I've undertaken for academic, self-learning, and pure curiosity. Each project is presented as a Jupyter notebook, with more visual details available on [My page](https://github.com/jfh5580)

**Please note**: The data used in these projects, found under the "data" directory, is for demonstration purposes only.

## üõ†Ô∏è Getting Started

To run these Python notebooks locally, follow these simple steps:

To run these Python notebooks on your local machine, follow these simple steps:

Python Installation:
Ensure you have Python installed on your computer. You can download Python from the official website here and follow the installation instructions for your operating system.

Package Manager:
Use a package manager like pip (Python's package installer) to install the required libraries and dependencies. Open your command prompt or terminal and run the following command, replacing <library_name> with the names of libraries mentioned in the notebook (e.g., NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, etc.). Install all the necessary libraries mentioned in the notebook.

bash
Copy code
pip install <library_name>
Jupyter Notebook:
If the notebook is in a Jupyter Notebook format (with the .ipynb extension), you need to install Jupyter Notebook. You can do this with pip:

bash
Copy code
pip install notebook
Launch Jupyter Notebook:
Open your command prompt or terminal, navigate to the directory where your notebook is located, and run the following command:

bash
Copy code
jupyter notebook
This will open a web browser displaying your local Jupyter Notebook environment.

Open Notebook:
In the Jupyter Notebook dashboard, navigate to the directory where your notebook is located and click on the notebook's name to open it.

Execute Code:
Inside the notebook, you can execute code cells one by one by selecting a cell and clicking the "Run" button or by using the Shift + Enter keyboard shortcut.

Save Your Work:
Make sure to save your changes in the notebook as you progress through it.

By following these steps, you should be able to run and interact with Python notebooks locally on your machine.
